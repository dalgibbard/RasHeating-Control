RasHeating-Control
==================


This is my own first little project to utilize rasberry PI to do home automation for central heating with gas boiled. In my case to switch boiler on I need to connect two pins on control panel of my boiler. To protect my rasberry I use relay which I gor of ebay.
What we'll need for this project is:
- Rasberry PI
- DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor 
- 4.7K Resistor
